# Available Examples
Comments in each example explain its purpose.

Introducing Variations:
## When the basic graph can be generated:
    DifferentBasicGraphDeterministicPartitioningExample.java
        Actions visualization of the above (i.e. pressing Right and Left arrows to apply actions or reverse them)
    DifferentBasicGraphDeterministicPartitioningActionsVisualizer.java
## When the basic graph cannot change:
    SameBasicGraphStochasticPartitioningExample.java 
        Actions visualization of the above (i.e. pressing Right and Left arrows to apply actions or reverse them)
    SameBasicGraphStochasticPartitioningActionsVisualizer.java
