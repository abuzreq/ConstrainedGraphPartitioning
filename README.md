# Note: 
    This is just an initial release for those wanting to experiment with the code early, I will add more explanations and examples of usage later one.

# About
This is the source code of the algorithm described in the paper:
"On Using Graph Partitioning with Isomorphism Constraint in Procedural Content Generation"
presented at PCG Workshop 2017 part of FDG 2017

# Available Examples
Comments in each example explain its purpose.

Introducing Variations:
## When the basic graph can be generated:
    DifferentBasicGraphDeterministicPartitioningExample.java
        Actions visualization of the above (i.e. pressing Right and Left arrows to apply actions or reverse them)
    DifferentBasicGraphDeterministicPartitioningActionsVisualizer.java
## When the basic graph cannot change:
    SameBasicGraphStochasticPartitioningExample.java 
        Actions visualization of the above (i.e. pressing Right and Left arrows to apply actions or reverse them)
    SameBasicGraphStochasticPartitioningActionsVisualizer.java
